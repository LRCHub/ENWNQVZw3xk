[00:18.46] My password is a dead aunt's name
[00:27.35] A monument, a testament
[00:36.36] My password is a dead aunt's name
[00:45.02] A cenotaph, a shallow grave
[01:12.05] I'm thirty one and fading fast
[01:20.43] Forget the past, repeat the past
[01:29.52] I'm thirty two and fading fast
[01:38.14] I started last and I finished last
