If you can't find, your own path
I'll lead you through the hills
If you've got the whole thing wrong
I'll show you what is real

If you can't trust anymore
I'll leave you breathless tied up still
So ya, ya, can feel

Because I am the one here
Who'll take your mind away
Til you love it, I, I will steer

Let me tie your hands, just scream my name
Give up on all kind of shame
Leave all the rest, adore the flesh
Come to me if you need
Lust
And if you wanna feel it
Trust
I'm the one to realize
Your fantasies, down on your knees
Just one word and it's all gone

If you can't leave your whole past, I will set your mind free
So ya, ya'll trust me

Because I am the one here
Who'll take your mind away
Til you need it, I, I won't stop this

Let me tie your hands, just scream my name
Give up on all kind of shame
Leave all the rest, adore the flesh
Come to me if you need
Lust
And if you wanna feel it
Trust
I'm the one to realize
Your fantasies, down on your knees
Just one word and it's all gone

There's something in your chest and it just keeps you locked to me
There's something that you beg for that will make you be still

There's something in your chest, it just keeps you locked to me
There's something 'round your neck that helps you out in the escape

Because I'm what your wish for
Because I'm what your wish for

Let me tie your hands, just scream my name
Give up on all kind of shame
Leave all the rest, adore the flesh
Come to me if you need
Lust
And if you wanna feel it
Trust
I'm the one to realize
Your fantasies, down on your knees
Just one word and it's all gone

There's something in your chest and it just keeps you locked to me
There's something that you beg for that will make you be still

There's something in your chest, it just keeps you locked to me
There's something 'round your neck that helps you out in the escape
