Lift your latch and let me pass
That's all I'm asking, girl
And forgive what's unorthodox
I fashioned this to slip your locks

So we might have a word
We had a fight I won last night
But who slept outside girl? What if I'm wrong
Help me along to give a bit and still look strong
I want to tell the world

Key to the lock of the heard password
Is something I believe we've earned
And If you're told
I'm bought and sold and soulless to be sure

Your friends would fight for your advice
It must be weird, he looked so nice
You're such a lucky girl

Key to the lock of the heard password
Its something I believe we've earned
Password, give us back what we deserve
