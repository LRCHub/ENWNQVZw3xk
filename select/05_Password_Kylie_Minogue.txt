You've wet my appetite
I want a taste of you tonight
I've got a look on me
Like a cat whose got the cream

I take you for a gambling man
I'll place my bets as high as I can
May be the one who can realise my dream
Shall we see?

Meet me in the bedroom
At quarter-past 11
Say the lucky words I'm looking for
And we'll be locking up the door

Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password (password)
To make it right (to make it right)

Tell me you're thinking hard
I don't want this to fall apart
I've gotta feeling that we could just make a team

I'm careful with my heart
I'm a fussy girl and love's an art
Tell me that you're hiding something up your sleeve
Please

Meet me in the bedroom
At quarter-past 11
Say the lucky words I'm looking for
And we'll be locking up the door

Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password (password)
To make it right (to make it right)
Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password (password)
I think you might (I think you might)

Tell me the password, baby

Understand I'm a lady
It's not the hand you've got but how you play it
Baby, what's the password? (Baby, baby)
Baby, what's the password? (Baby, baby)
Baby, what's the password? (Baby, baby)
Baby, what's the password? (Baby, baby)
Baby, what's the password?

Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password (password)
(Oh baby, what's the password?)
To make it right (to make it right)

Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password (password)
To make it right (to make it right)
Tell me, tell me
Ooh
